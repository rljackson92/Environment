# Environment Description

	The web stack  composition that I use on my local system is LAMP: Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP. Currently my mac operating system will be running the LAMP stack. The versions of MySQL, PHP, and Apache I am running on my computer are the same versions recommended in the lecture slides. The versions are PHP 5.6.3, Apache 2.2, and MySQL 5.6. I also have MAMP on my system, to solve potential consistency problems between team members. Additionally, I use Sublime as my main text editor because of its' color coding properties.
