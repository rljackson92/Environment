Your repository name does not follow the instruction (i.e., INST377-[your_lastname]) (-1).
You did not provide the URL of your Github-based webpage that should be following the "github.io" naming. (-5).

Other than that, great job! For ".md" files, in the future, I suggest using Markdown syntax rather than HTML tags (not important, but some platforms don't support for HTML tags for .md files).
